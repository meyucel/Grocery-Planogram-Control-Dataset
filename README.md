# Grocery Planogram Control Dataset


We formed our planogram control dataset from the conventional grocery store in Turkey. We used a Samsung S10 Plus mobile phone with a 16 MP ultra-wide camera to capture images in this dataset. 

Our dataset is composed of four distinct subsets: 

* Our first subset is composed of 14 shelf images to test the performance of the proposed method. We crop these images such that each has only one row of objects. Hence, the total number of images became 28, with 312 objects in them. We also obtain a high-resolution image of each object from the web to form the reference planogram. Then, we annotate all the objects in the acquired shelf images. 
* The second subset is composed of 14 shelf images with 124 objects in them. Among these, 64 objects are occluded. Therefore, this subset is specific to test the performance of the proposed method on occluded objects on the shelf. 
* Our third subset is composed of 15 images, acquired from five shelves with three different viewing angles, with 75 objects in them. Hence, this subset is specific to test the performance of the proposed method on different viewing angles for the shelf. 
* The fourth subset is composed of 48 objects placed on top of each other. Therefore, it is specific to test the performance of the proposed method on the objects placed on top of each other.
